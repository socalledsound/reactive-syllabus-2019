<h3>Course Objectives</h3>

<p>This studio course aims to provide students with the digital tools for expanding and  augmenting their work in traditional media such as photography and sculpture  and also to encourage the exploration of new hybrid forms of art-making.  In other words, if you have ever been interested in exploring sound,sensors, immersive experience,  interactivity, bots, wearable computing, gamification, AI,  feedback systems, process-oriented artwork or data-driven artworks in any media….then this may be the class for you.   We will work with electronics and electrical circuits and also write the software to bring our inventions to life.   This class will be particularly interesting for students who are curious about coding but have always been intimidated or bored by the technical requirements.  You will learn to use basic software for the manipulation of sound,  image and video and you will also learn to build simple software and hardware -- using tools (like p5.js, sonic pi, makey-make, arduino and others) that were designed by artists for artists and will let you  access that material on a more fundamental level and develop a formal approach to digital media (and hacked physical media!) that is all your own</p>

<h3>Course Methodology </h3>
<p>Class time will be a mixture of  lab time, critique, lecture and discussion.  We may have one or more visiting artists and we may make a field trip.  Equipment will be available to check out from the department.  We will learn to write and use a variety of digital tools in the Mac-based computer lab in room 295.  Lectures, equipment demonstrations and technical practice will take place in room 285 and room 295 as well as outside the classroom. Students will be asked to maintain a photo blog which documents their work and growth over the course of the semester.  Daily readings will be available on the course server and via the course website.</p>

<h3>Course Costs</h3> 
<p>1.There is a $60 lab fee charged to students in the course. The lab fee covers the maintenance and replacement of the production and editing equipment you use.You must immediately pay this fee or you will not be able to reserve or check out equipment or gain access to the computer lab (room 295). Payment is via Cal card only. 2.You should purchase some form of external storage medium to back up your work, a USB flash drive will probably be enough, although larger drives might be handy and are of course fine. Please remember that you should always back up a copy (or two!) of your work and take it home with you; there isn't any acceptable excuse for losing your work to drive failure, ever. </p>

<h3>Lab and Equipment Use Policies </h3>
<p>In order to use any production equipment (cameras, mics, tripods, lights, etc.) you must sign a contract with the university.This will make you responsible for loss or intentional damage of equipment. Equipment will be available for use during a 24 hour period from an equipment cage located in Room 295.Advance reservations for the equipment can be made up to one week in advance on a sign-up board in the vestibule of Room 295. Equipment sign up procedure and 
location is to be explained by Dillon Thomas, who is in charge of our facilities and equipment. Check-in and check-out hours will be set during the first week of classes. 
If you have special needs for presenting your work in class please let me know ahead of time so we may reserve the necessary equipment. 
Access to room 295 will be to students enrolled in media classes, and approved video lab technicians. Once you have paid your fee and signed a contract with us, you will receive a numeric code for a keypad on the door.Any use of computers or production equipment by people other than your classmates or lab techs is forbidden. If you see or know of individuals who are doing so, please report this to to Dillon Thomas, or to me.You are on your honor not to share your door code or production equipment with anyone, and if it is found that you have, you risk being dropped from the class, losing all equipment privileges, and/or paying for lost or broken equipment. </p>

<h3>Grades</h3> 
<p>Your grade will be based on the following:</p> 
<p>25% attendance, class participation </p>
<p>35% daily assignments / your blog</p>
<p>15% midterm </p>
<p>25% final project</p>
